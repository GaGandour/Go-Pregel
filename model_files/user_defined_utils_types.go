/*
	If you need to define any types, do it in this file.

	You can be creative here and do anything you want to help you
	in your journey, like defining a struct that will be used in
	your algorithm, or defining a type that will be used in the
	VertexValue or EdgeValue structs.

	However, I don't take responsability for any weird behavior
	that might happen and I didn't think of.

	But if you are reasonable enough, it will work.
